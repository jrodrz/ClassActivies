// Array Activity 1
// Create an Array called students that contains the names of 5 students
students[Jack, Jill, Billy, Jo, Bob];
// Use bracket notation to access and print the name of the 4th student in the list, then print the name of the student in index 2
console.log(student[3]);
// Loop over the Array to print out each name

// Array Activity 2
// Create a variable called roster and assign it the value of the string below
// "These are the students in the list: "

// Loop over the Array again, but this time each iteration of the loop should add the value to the end of the roster string AND a blank space
// After the loop, print roster

// The expected output should look like this:
// "These are the students in the list: name1 name2 name3 name4 name5"
