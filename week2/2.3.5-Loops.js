// Follow the steps below to create a **while** loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number
//let num = 5

// 2) create a variable to represent the current total
//let current = 6

// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
for (let i = 1; i <=100; i++) {
  total = 1 + i++
}
  console.log (total)
// Now using the same variables you created in steps 1 and 2, create a **for** loops that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) write a for loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
